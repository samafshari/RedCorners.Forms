# RedCorners.Forms

RedCorners.Forms brings some neat utilities to your Xamarin.Forms applications

Features:
- Content views and view models can know when they appear and disappear if they derive from `ContentView2` and `BindableModel`.
- `MessagingCenter` on steroids: Extension methods to easily define messages on `Enums` and `string`s with a very simple and intuitive syntax.
- `UpdateProperties()`: Signal the update of all of a view model's properties.
- `Button2`: A button that properly reacts to press, release and click gestures.
- `HorizontalShadow`, `HorizontalShadow2`: Horizontal shadow views you can use to give depth to your UI.
- `PageCommand`: Make a Button open a new page directly from XAML without any code behind.
- `PopCommand`: Make a Button pop a modal page directly from XAML without any code behind.
- `TitleBar`: A very powerful and custom titlebar that looks nice and identical across both iOS and Android.
- `SideBar`: A very powerful and flexible sidebar that opens up from any direction, with customizable width, height, background color, slide and fade animations and more!
- `TabBar`: A very powerful and cross-platform Tabbar.
- `TitledContentView`: A content view that has a dynamic titlebar.
- `TabbedContentPage`: A content page that has a dynamic tabbar.
- Notch padding compensation: Dynamically adjust the paddings necessary on devices with the notch.
- `GetPage()`: An extension method which allows an `Element` to find its parent `Page`.
